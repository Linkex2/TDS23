            Running The Apache Tomcat 9.0 Servlet/JSP Container
            ===================================================

Apache Tomcat 9.0 requires a Java Standard Edition Runtime
Environment (JRE) version 8 or later.

=============================
Running With JRE 8 Or Later
=============================

(1) Download and Install a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE)

(1.1) Download a Java SE Runtime Environment (JRE),
      release version 8 or later, from
      http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

(1.2) Install the JRE according to the instructions included with the
      release.

      You may also use a full Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than just
      a JRE.


(2) Download and Install Apache Tomcat

(2.1) Download a binary distribution of Tomcat from:

      https://tomcat.apache.org/

(2.2) Unpack the binary distribution so that it resides in its own
      directory (conventionally named "apache-tomcat-[version]").

      For the purposes of the remainder of this document, the name
      "CATALINA_HOME" is used to refer to the full pathname of that
      directory.

NOTE:  As an alternative to downloading a binary distribution, you can
create your own from the Tomcat source code, as described in
"BUILDING.txt".  You can either

  a)  Do the full "release" build and find the created distribution in the
      "output/release" directory and then proceed with unpacking as above, or

  b)  Do a simple build and use the "output/build" directory as
      "CATALINA_HOME".  Be warned that there are some differences between the
      contents of the "output/build" directory and a full "release"
      distribution.


(3) Configure Environment Variables

Tomcat is a Java application and does not use environment variables directly.
Environment variables are used by the Tomcat startup scripts. The scripts use
the environment variables to prepare the command that starts Tomcat.

(3.1) Set CATALINA_HOME (required) and CATALINA_BASE (optional)

The CATALINA_HOME environment variable should be set to the location of the
root directory of the "binary" distribution of Tomcat.

The Tomcat startup scripts have some logic to set this variable
automatically if it is absent, based on the location of the startup script
in *nix and on the current directory in Windows. That logic might not work
in all circumstances, so setting the variable explicitly is recommended.

The CATALINA_BASE environment variable specifies location of the root
directory of the "active configuration" of Tomcat. It is optional. It
